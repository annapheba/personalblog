<br>explain how this amazing organisation brings each and every engineer under one roof - the
<br>ultimate networking platform. They introduced us to a world which was beyond something that
<br>was purely technical, that was an introduction to the family which was IEEE GECBH. The best part
<br>is that we were inspired enough to believe that this one is worth the $27 price that comes with it.
<br>It’s been three years of membership and trust us, not one day have we regretted paying for this.
<br>The opportunities that this organisation offers to each person is limitless. We remember with
<br>thanks, our dear seniors who paved the way for many IEEE GECBians like us. Life has never been
<br>the same since the day we were selected to be the part of the IEEE GECBH Execom 2015. We
<br>were surprised, excited and anxious being the Membership Development Coordinators. And right
<br>now, as we type this out, we are filled with satisfaction, happiness, a sense of achievement and a
tinge of sadness of leaving this family in a few days. But why not? After three Execoms, we are
<br>the proud Chairpersons of the <strong>Best Student Branch</strong> in Kerala! Oh yes, this is fascinating than we can convey in words. :)&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8">IEEE nurtures you not just to be technically sound but also highlights the need to do everything in
<div>a way that is beneficial to humanity at large. Each of us was shaped by this organisation which
</div><div>has a magical impact on the way we think and the way we approach various obstacles in life. Each
</div><div>event was a learning packed with lots of memories to cherish. Just as the SB brought every
</div><div>member of the organisation together irrespective of branches and years, IEEE brought together
</div><div>like-minded people from different parts of the world. Working with teams from Hub Level to R10
</div><div>level, we have made friends close to the heart. For all those who are hesitant to join IEEE just
</div><div>because of the ‘heavy’ membership fee, we ask you to just be part of this wonderful family for a
</div><div>year. Take part in all its activities, volunteer and network to your fullest and you’ll definitely
</div><div>renew and you may even be motivated enough to be Life Senior Members of IEEE. Yes, it’s true
</div><div>IEEE happens to be the only society where you can find octogenarian geniuses work with the
</div><div>same enthusiasm and vigour as a twenty-something youth.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Quoting one of our team members, Benjamin John Oommen, over here. This is the perfect
</div><div>example of how much important IEEE has been to each one of us!</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><em>“From being a lazy kid in the first year, if I have changed enough to be part of the College Union
</em></div><div><em>and organise events with confidence, the reason is this - I decided to take that IEEE membership at
</em></div><div><em>the end of my first year. The first official platform that not only showcased the importance of
</em></div><div><em>professionalism but also provided umpteen opportunities to practice it and grow up as a person
</em></div><div><em>and an Engineer. Handling insane situations, last-minute troubles, finance and logistics with
</em></div><div><em>patience is an art. This is where I started learning them - the beginning. I have understood that
</em></div><div><em>the #JoyOfVolunteering is the satisfaction we enjoy, the memories made and the learning from
</em></div><div><em>experiences after each successful event. Thank you, IEEE!”</em></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><em>
</em></div><div>
</div><div>We are filled with gratitude and respect to our predecessors like Ashik, Paul, Sreeram, Gokul,
</div><div>Rakesh, Nirmal, Nandu, Hari, Devika, Akhila, Siddhart to name a few. To all of you who were with
</div><div>us when we did our membership development sessions, to staying up until way past midnight
</div><div>during THM 2016, to sharing with us every pain and happiness in this journey, we owe you big
</div><div>time. This expedition would not have been so much fun or exciting without Benjamin (The one
</div><div>who handled the finances with ease and ensured that everything was perfect), Aiswarya Bright
</div><div>(The Membership Development Head under whom we grew to 250 plus members), Keerthi (the
</div><div>silent worker and the one who attends to the details), Saadia (the lady who gave us this chance to
</div><div>write), Naufal (The reliable all-in-all), Aiswarya M Nair and Shibanni who were the face of IEEE
</div><div>GECBH in almost five R10 and international Conferences, Nakshathru (the creative genius and
</div><div>lazy coder), Manish (the inevitable DSLR man) and all our wonderful juniors Ashwin, Aswathy,
</div><div>Minu, Lekshmi, Rojin, Aja, Sharanya, Hari, Ajay, Rafi, Rohini and many more! All this would have
</div><div>never been possible without the guidance, ever inspiring and motivating men like Prof. Anu
</div><div>Mohammed and Prof. Biju K. S. who were with us day in and out.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>We hope that we will always yearn to be the Best in the years and be a role model for all. IEEE
</div><div>believes in bringing about technological changes for the betterment of humanity. Come
</div><div>experience the ‘Joy of Volunteering’ with IEEE and we welcome each and every one of you to the
</div><div>IEEE GECBH family. As we step down, we are confident that we are leaving this family in better
</div><div>hands. All best wishes!</div></div>
